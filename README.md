# Lung Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to predict the risk of lung cancer using machine learning models. The project involves data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to build a system capable of classifying individuals as having or not having lung cancer based on various demographic, behavioral, and medical features.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset collected through surveys. It includes information about individuals, such as gender, age, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, and symptoms related to lung health. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, duplicates, and categorical features before being used for model training.

## Methodology

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:** The dataset is loaded using Pandas, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the data's structure, distributions, and potential correlations.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Categorical features are encoded using a mapping, and the dataset is split into training and testing sets. The training data is scaled using StandardScaler to improve model performance.
3. **Model Selection and Training:** Various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost, are considered. Cross-validation is used to evaluate the performance of each model, and the model with the highest accuracy is selected.
4. **Model Evaluation:** The selected model is evaluated on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results

The project identifies the most effective machine learning model for predicting lung cancer risk based on the dataset. The results are presented with metrics and visualizations to demonstrate the model's performance and potential for real-world applications.
